            <p class="lead">Indian architecture is a layered dialogue between climate, craft, ritual and material. At
              Abin
              Design Studio we translate those layers into contemporary spaces that feel timeless yet modern.</p>

            <h2>1. Context is a Foundation</h2>
            <p>From the courtyard houses of the Deccan to the stepwells of Gujarat, Indian buildings evolved in response
              to local climate, available material and cultural rituals. We begin design by understanding context: the
              sun
              path, prevailing winds, local craft traditions and community life.</p>

            <h3>Traditional Lessons </h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Passive cooling:</strong> verandahs, courtyards and jaali screens reduce heat gain.</li>
              <li><strong>Material economy:</strong> building with local stone, brick and lime minimizes transport and
                creates buildings that age gracefully.</li>
              <li><strong>Sequential spaces:</strong> thresholds and layered rooms manage privacy and ceremony.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Materials & Craft</h4>
            <p>We collaborate with local artisans to revive techniques — carved timber screens, lime plaster finishes,
              and
              patterned brickwork — merging these with modern joinery and structure.</p>

            <h5>Case Study: A Courtyard Home</h5>
            <p>In one of our residential projects, a central courtyard becomes the climatic heart: it provides
              ventilation, daylight and a social anchor. This approach borrows directly from traditional Indian homes
              but
              uses contemporary detailing and structural systems.</p>

            <blockquote class="callout">
              <h6>Design maxim</h6>
              <p class="muted">"A modern home should read like a belonging — responsive to place, people and time."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>3. Sustainability as Tradition </h3>
            <p>Many vernacular strategies are inherently sustainable. We adopt and reframe them to meet today's
              environmental needs:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Harvest rainwater and store it in integrated tanks and lined courtyards.</li>
              <li>Use passive shading and cross-ventilation to cut mechanical cooling loads.</li>
              <li>Prioritise low-embodied-energy materials and local procurement.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Design Approach: Principles We Follow</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Respect for scale and rhythm (façade proportions inspired by local precedents).</li>
              <li>Human-centred spaces (rooms designed around daily life and rituals).</li>
              <li>Material honesty (allow surfaces to age and tell a story).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Signature Elements We Use</h3>
            <p>Below are recurring elements in our work that link present to past:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Patterned screens (jaali-style) for filtered light and privacy.</li>
              <li>Layered thresholds that sequence public → semi-private → private spaces.</li>
              <li>Textured walls and crafted joinery that celebrate local skills.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>At Abin Design Studio, Indian history is not an archive to be copied but a living toolkit. We extract
              principles — of climate, craft and community — and reinterpret them with modern technology and sustainable
              practice to design spaces that feel right for today and last for generations.</p>
